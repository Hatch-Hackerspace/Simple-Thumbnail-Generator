# Simple-Thumbnail-Generator
An simple bash script thumbnail generator.

This is a simple bash script to resize jpg images to a box of specified values while preserving aspect ratio. You should run it from the folder with the images you want resized (you may need to run as root). It ignores files marked with the current pre tag (and overwrites them). Also tells you how many files were proccessed.

This script was made by George Marusteru @ Hatch Hackerspace Bucharest

This script is offered as is, you can consider it GPLv3 liscence, meaning this is free software and you can do whatever you want with it except release it in a different liscence.
