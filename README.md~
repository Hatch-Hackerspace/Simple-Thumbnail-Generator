# Simple-Thumbnail-Generator
An simple bash script thumbnail generator.

This is a simple bash script to resize jpg images to a box of specified values while preserving aspect ratio. You should run it from the folder with the images you want resized (you may need to run as root). It ignores files marked with the current pre tag and moves them to a folder named with the pre tag (so you can run it a few times). Also tells you how many files were proccessed.

This script was made by George Marusteru @ Hatch Hackerspace Bucharest

This script is offered as is, you can consider it GPLv3 license, meaning this it is free software and you can do whatever you want with it except release it in a different license.
